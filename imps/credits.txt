While the concept and application of the mod have been the work of Astebrooke, most important functions in the mod have been created by or with the assistance of ZenonSeth, without whom this mod would not exist in anything resembling its current state.

• Rift generation and crystallization (the scope of this entry is so much greater than its line would indicate)
